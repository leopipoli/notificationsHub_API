# NotificationsHub

## Description
The application is a web platform for managing notifications. It features various tabs for registering each type of notification (email, SMS, and web). Each tab is made available only when the corresponding item is selected in the registration of the application that will consume NotificationsHub.

## Features
The application allows notifications to be registered by other applications for consumption. In this initial phase of the project, the registration steps were developed without support for images and files. In future iterations, we will incrementally develop additional features and validations.
